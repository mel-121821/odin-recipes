# odin-recipes

Welcome to my first Odin project

For this project, I will building a basic recipe website. 
By the time of its completion, I hope to be confident in the following skills:

- Using basic HTML tags/elements/attributes
- Creating absolute and relative links
- Creating links to image sources
- Creating ordered and unordered lists
- Practicing git commits
