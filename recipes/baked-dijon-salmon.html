    <h2>Savoury, sweet and delicious, you'll be eating this right out of the pan!</h2>
    <p>Salmon has always been one of my favourite foods growing up. It was one of those things where I would always go back for seconds, no matter how full I was. In the past, I'd always had it with lemon and dill, but a few years ago I found this recipe and salmon dinner took on a whole new meaning! Hope you enjoy!</p>
