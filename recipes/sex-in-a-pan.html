    <h2>Layers of chocolatey goodness!</h2>
    <p>The name says it all folks! One of the best desserts ever, and no baking involved! With 4 delicious layers of graham crust, chocolate pudding, cream cheese and whipped cream, it's super easy to make. Just try not to eat it all in one sitting!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups of graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1 8oz block of cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>1 envelope of whipped cream <em>or</em> 2 cups of cool whip, <em>divided</em></li>
        <li>one pakage of instant pudding. <em> Chocolate is recommended for this version, but feel free to use any flavour you wish.</em></li>
        <li>one large chocolate bar, <em>shaved</em></li>
        <li><em>Make sure you check the graham crumb, pudding and whipped cream packages to ensure you have the ingredients you need to follow their instructions.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Before assembling the layers, prepare the instant pudding as described on the box. Place in the fridge to thicken.</li>
        <li><em>Also prepare the whipped cream if using the envelope, and set aside.</em></li>
        <li>For first layer, prepare the graham cracker crust as directed on the box. Layer it on the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>For second layer, whip the cream cheese and gradually add sugar. Beat until smooth, add whipped cream (either 1/2 the envelope or 1 cup of cool whip) and mix again. Place this layer on top of the graham crust.</li>
        <li>Check the pudding to see if it's thickened. If it has, spread it over the cream cheese layer.</li>
        <li>Spread the remaining whipped cream or cool whip on top of the pudding layer.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle chocolate shavings on top.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
